## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- VS Code with Live Server extension (recommended)
- Firebase project with proper configuration

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install VS Code Live Server Extension**
   - Open VS Code
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey
   - Install the extension

2. **Run Both Applications**
   - **Customer Store**: Right-click on `user/index.html` → "Open with Live Server"
   - **Admin Panel**: Right-click on `admin/admin.html` → "Open with Live Server"
   - Both will open in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`
   - You can run both simultaneously in different tabs

3. **Alternative: Use Any Local Server**
   - Python: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - Node.js: `npx serve .`
   - PHP: `php -S localhost:8000`

## 📱 Applications Overview

### 🛒 Customer Store (`user/` folder)
- **Purpose**: Customer-facing store interface
- **Features**: Product browsing, shopping cart, user authentication, order placement
- **Target Users**: Customers who want to shop
- **Access**: Open to all users

### 👨‍💼 Admin Panel (`admin/` folder)
- **Purpose**: Store management and administration
- **Features**: Product management, order tracking, customer messages, analytics
- **Target Users**: Store administrators and staff
- **Access**: Requires admin authentication

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Why Local Server is Required
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** requires HTTPS or localhost
- **Service Workers** cannot be registered on `file://` protocol
- **Push notifications** will not work without proper server setup

### Common Errors and Solutions

#### Error: "A bad HTTP response code (404) was received when fetching the script"
**Solution**: Use a local server instead of opening the file directly in the browser.

#### Error: "FCM token generation failed: Messaging: We are unable to register the default service worker"
**Solution**: Ensure you're running on `http://localhost` or `https://` protocol.

#### Error: "The current domain is not authorized for OAuth operations"
**Solution**: Add `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` to your Firebase project's authorized domains.

## 🔧 Firebase Configuration

### Required Firebase Services
- Authentication
- Realtime Database
- Cloud Messaging (FCM)

### Authorized Domains
Add these to your Firebase project:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
2. Add: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`
3. Add your production domain when deploying

### Shared Configuration
- Both applications use the same Firebase project
- `firebase-messaging-sw.js` is shared between both applications
- Update Firebase config in all files when changing projects

## 🛠️ Development

### Running Individual Applications
- **Customer Store**: Navigate to `user/` folder and run `index.html`
- **Admin Panel**: Navigate to `admin/` folder and run `admin.html`

### Running Both Simultaneously
- Use Live Server to open both files
- Each will run on different ports (e.g., 5500, 5501)
- Both can access the same Firebase backend

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Requirements
- HTTPS domain
- Firebase project with production configuration
- Update Firebase config in all files
- Ensure domain is authorized in Firebase console

### Local Development
- Use Live Server or similar local server
- Test on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
- Firebase will work in development mode

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that you're using a local server (not file:// protocol)
2. Verify Firebase configuration is correct
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Ensure all required files are in the same directory
5. Check individual folder README files for specific instructions

## 🔒 Security

- Customer store requires user authentication for orders
- Admin panel requires admin authentication
- Firebase security rules should be configured
- Never expose Firebase config keys in public repositories
- Use environment variables for production deployments

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Setup Firebase Project**: Configure Firebase with required services
2. **Run Customer Store**: Start with `user/index.html` for customer interface
3. **Run Admin Panel**: Start with `admin/admin.html` for administration
4. **Test Integration**: Verify both applications work together
5. **Customize**: Modify features and styling as needed
